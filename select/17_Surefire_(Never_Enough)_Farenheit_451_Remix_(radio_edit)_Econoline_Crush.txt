she,
goes ballistic on me
says I don't meet her needs
and she's had enough I guess

me,
I wish I could be
satisfied either way
but i'm not... yeah...

never enough now,
never enough now,
come on,
take it all the way
never enough, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
take it all the way

never enough now,
never enough now,
come on,
take it all the way
never enough, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
take it all the way

she,
feels a pain I can't heal
has her hands on the wheel
takes it in a moves along

me,
I live not to see
swim the deep tragedy
drowning in my own self-interest

never enough now
never enough now
come on,
take it all the way
never enough, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
take it all the way

never enough now,
never enough now,
come on,
take it all the way
never enough, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
take it all the way
