Practice patience, nowadays I'm gettin' sleep
Said you ride for me but would you die for me?
All them cameras in my face don't mean a thing
Shout out to [?] spend 'bout fifteen on his ring
'Fore this rappin' shit you love me just for me
Obvious status everybody want a piece
That bitch mine but I don't got her on no leash
Me and my partners finna turn this to a feast
Fifty pills inside that Louis bag
Glory go to God, I'm glad I'm doin' that
When you realize where you fucked up, that make you a man
From the bottom we ain't grew up with the upper hand, yeah

Said she sick and tired, want some time
That shit hurt to know what's really on your mind
I wanna waste day and nights
Baby I just hope that everything's alright

I just need some love to take away the pressure
I can't lose myself tryna hold this shit together
I keep callin' you, I guess we lost connection
I need more from you, I'm feelin' too much pressure

I just need some love to take away the pressure
I can't lose myself tryna hold this shit together
I keep callin' you, I guess we lost connection
I need more from you, I'm feelin' too much pressure

Don't make a fool out of me (yeah)
Never text me back, have me chasin' you around
Like you owe me something, oh
Promises undelivered, I held my part down tho'
Just play your role, make sure your body don't bounce, no, oh woah
'Cause I know exactly how you feel
Actions speak louder than words that you've been screamin'
Don't try and stop me now, oh woah

I just need some love to take away the pressure
I can't lose myself tryna hold this shit together
I keep callin' you, I guess we lost connection
I need more from you, I'm feelin' too much pressure

I just need some love to take away the pressure
I can't lose myself tryna hold this shit together
I keep callin' you, I guess we lost connection
I need more from you, I'm feelin' too much pressure
