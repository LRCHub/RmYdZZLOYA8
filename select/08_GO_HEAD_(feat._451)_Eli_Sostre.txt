My heart starts to beat slow when the pressure hit
No friends or family no co-signs but still he lit
I like you done hold it down
She buss it open, do a split
She like the lifestyle
Was either you die or get rich
I gave my all to you, can't fall for you
Let's take a trip
Don't even know the truth no more
'Cause they be fakin' shit
I put my faith in me
I went and made that paper flip
I let them take from me and soon come
They gon' pay for it
I need that shit on tenfold
Used to stare up out my window
Like, "I need this and that one
New Bentley, need the black one
Two hoes on Danny Phantom
I start to peep their patterns
I just kick the madness
Some shit don't even matter
She say she into fashion
I told her take that shit off
No time, I gotta get up
Demons i'm gettin' rid off
You lost your mind, if you cross me
You get stuck in the middle
I got some diamonds, they look like coffee
I ain't afraid to hit 'em

Uh, yeah, you steppin' out, go 'head
Show me what that shit about, go 'head
Yeah, you bad, it ain't no doubt, go 'head
When I'm away that shit gon' fuck with your head
Yeah, you steppin' out, go 'head
Show me what that shit about, go 'head
Yeah, you bad, it ain't no doubt, go 'head
When I'm away that shit gon' fuck with your head

I know it ain't easy
Why you playin' defense?
Baby girl, don't tempt me
I'm leanin' off the (Off the)
I'm tryna get higher, she my ride or dier
Pop it like you hold me up, pop it like(Pop it like)
Yeah, pop it like, this is paradise
You look more than nice
I'ma need some extra time
I've spend so many nights lookin' for the right kind
You know that's you, ooh, yeah

Uh, yeah, you steppin' out, go 'head
Show me what that shit about, go 'head
Yeah, you bad, it ain't no doubt, go 'head
When I'm away that shit gon' fuck with your head
Yeah, you steppin' out, go 'head
Show me what that shit about, go 'head
Yeah, you bad, it ain't no doubt, go 'head
When I'm away that shit gon' fuck with your head

Uh, yeah, you steppin' out, go 'head
Show me what that shit about, go 'head
Yeah, you bad, it ain't no doubt, go 'head
When I'm away that shit gon' fuck with your head

Whine
We'll go everywhere 'til we end up in the bed
Put some ice on, we still lookin'
Just show you how
Yeah, yeah-yeah
