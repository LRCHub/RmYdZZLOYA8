Fire engulfing
Bleeding the red skies
It's our demise
A consequence of corruption

These walls of death
Burning through all of their flesh

Eyes boil and bubbles as our homes fall to ash
Our family cries penetrate the sound of crackling gas

Flesh seared I'm limping away

Under red skies
Charred skin and blackened eyes
Bodies scattered on fence lines
Failing to escape

Millions perished
Millions more fall
Skies weep for their death
A red sun for the dead

These walls of death
Burning their flesh
Eyes boil and bubbles as our homes fall to ash
Our Family cries penetrate the sound of crackling gas

Charred skin under these red skies
Watching home melt away
In Mother's cries
Skin squirting in the heat of the flame
The last glimpse through my eyes
Charred skin Under these red skies
With my blackened eyes
Watching my home burn to ash

Entire coastlines up in flames

Flesh seared i'm melting away
These walls of death
Devouring everything that's left

Lighting up the night sky
It weeps for my death
A red moon for the dead
Flesh turned to ash

Muscle tissue melts into a mass
Bone marrow evaporates into gas
Eyeballs burst into flames
Life burns to death
